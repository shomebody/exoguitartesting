# Assembly

ExoGuitar is a complicated project.  It has a bunch of hardware and a bunch of different parts.  I hope you can understand how this can make documenting this a challenge, especially for a single person with a full-time job on top of a small business to run.  That being said; there are likely gaps in this documentation.  If you want to assist, it is EXTREMELY welcone for you to reach out. 

## Choosing your parts

Before you start printing an ExoGuitar, you need to decide which kind of guitar you are trying to build.  Do you want an electric or an accoustic?  Printed neck or wooden neck?  What body style do you want? Headless or Head?  Printed bridge or one off-the-shelf?

One day I hope I can have the time and resources to build a configurator.  For right now, however, this is a pretty manual process. 

There are 7 main parts that each have their own options:

1. [Shoulder](/models/Shoulders/)
    - Offset 
        - ExoGuitar Neck - See Chosen ExoGuitar Neck Assembly
        - [Wood Neck](/models/Shoulders/Offset%20-%20Regular%20Neck/ASSEMBLY.md)
    - Paralell
        - [Wood Neck](/models/Shoulders/Parallel%20-%20Regular%20Neck/ASSEMBLY.md)
2. [Neck](/models/Neck/) - Note: you can skip this if you use a wooden neck. 
    - [Metal Frets](/models/Neck/Horizontal/ASSEMBLY.md) - Note: this is a REALLY intensive build
    - [Filament Frets](/models/Neck/Vertical/Filament%20Frets/ASSEMBLY.md) - Note: This is my recommendation.
    - [Fretless](/models/Neck/Vertical/Fretless/ASSEMBLY.md)
    - [Printed Frets](/models/Neck/Neck%20with%20Printed%20Frets/ASSEMBLY.md)
3. [Head](/models/Head/) - Note: you can skip this if you use a wooden neck
    - [Classical](/models/Head/Classical/ASSEMBLY.md) - Note: I have only tested this with nylon strings; I make NO promises that it can handle metal strings or the forces that they apply. 
    - [Arrow](/models/Head/Head/ASSEMBLY.md)
    - [Explorer](/models/Head/Explorer/ASSEMBLY.md)
    - [Firebird](/models/Head/Firebird/ASSEMBLY.md)

        - [Blank](/models/Bridge/Blank/) - Note: this is a starting point for you to model your own bridge
5. [Face Plate](/models/Face%20Plates/)
    - [Acoustic](/models/Face%20Plates/Acoustic/ASSEMBLY.md)
    - [Dual Humbucker](/models/Face%20Plates/Dual%20Humbucker/ASSEMBLY.md)
    - [Single Humbucker](/models/Face%20Plates/Single%20Humbucker/ASSEMBLY.md)

    - [Telecaster](/models/Face%20Plates/Telecaster/ASSEMBLY.md)
    - [Stealth Plate](/models/Face%20Plates/StealthPlate/ASSEMBLY.md) - Note: This is an experimental face plate that covers the pickups with a thin piece of plastic that you can add decoration to.  It's fun but likely not the best sounding option. 
    - [Clip-in Compartment](/models/Face%20Plates/Clip-In%20Compartment/ASSEMBLY.md) - Note: This is my initial prototype face plate.  It is not recommended unless you want to swap faces often.
6. [Back](/models/Back/)
    Note: The accoustic face plate has it's own back as part of it's resonation chamber. 
    - [Screw On](/models/Back/Screw%20On/) - Do you want to be able to get to your electronics from the back?  This is the option for you
    - [Slide In](/models/Back/Slide%20In/) - Do you want to glue the back in place and access electronics from the front?  Use this one
7. [Wing Set](/models/Wing%20Sets/)
    The only thing you really need to worry about with the wing sets is if they will work with the shoulder you chose earlier.  
    - Offset Shoulder
        - [Banj-No](/models/Wing%20Sets/BanjNo/)
        - [Less Paul](/models/Wing%20Sets/Less%20Paul/)

        - [Firebird](/models/Wing%20Sets/Firebird/)
        - [Rich](/models/Wing%20Sets/Rich/) - Note: Looks the best with the Headless Bridge Plate
        - [Venom](/models/Wing%20Sets/Venom/) - This is the Rich with spider webs in it.
        - [Kumiko](/models/Wing%20Sets/Kumiko/ASSEMBLY.md)
    - Parallel Shoulder
        - [Training-V](/models/Wing%20Sets/Training-V/)
    - Both
        - [Cyber Butterfly](/models/Wing%20Sets/Cyber%20Butterfly/)
8. [Strap](/models/Strap/)
    - [Printed Strap](./models/Strap/Chain%20Link%20Strap/ASSEMBLY.md) - Works but you must be gentile with it; any twisting could break it. 
    - [Nylon Strap](./models/Strap/Nylon%20Strap/ASSEMBLY.md) - Requires a Heavy Duty Sewing Machine
    
## Ordering your Hardware

Once you have picked your parts, get the BOM.txt file from each part and figure out how much of each part you need and then order them.  

## Begin Assembly

### Shoulder

I have found that it's easiest to start with the shoulder and then build out from there.  The first thing I would suggest doing is tapping the ends of all of your 2020 extrusion.  Some 2020 extrusion comes with a 5mm hole and some come with a 6mm hole, so make sure you tap it with the right size.  You will need to tap at least one end of each piece of extrusion depending on the parts you are using.  It may be a good idea to tap all of them; just in case.  

Note for those who have never tapped before:  Use cutting fluid.  Go SLOW.  Like slower than you think.  Go a few turns and then do at least one full rotation backwards, then repeat.  If you're using a drill, make sure to set it to like 6-7 so it won't snap your tap.  

Beyond this, follow the assembly guide in your chosen shoulder and then come back here

### Face Plate

Follow the assembly guide in your chosen face plate, and then come back here

### Bridge 

If you chose to do a Bearing Bridge, follow the assembly documentation in that and then come back here. 

Follow the assembly guide in your chosen bridge plate, then come back here.

### Wing Set

All wing sets follow a certain pattern, so I'll just describe it here in general for now. 
- If you are printing an electric you need to print the solid part with the electronics compartment and assemble that.  If you are printing an accoustic, you can print whatever part you feel makes it look coolest. 
- There should be blank files if you want a different knob / switch / User Interface setup than the one in the standard files. 
- The back of the electronics compartment will be held on by press-insert magnets.  Insert them into the body and then pop a magnet onto the ones you have inserted and then press the back onto those magnets to ensure that you have the correct polarity.  They should be press fit but if that doesn't work you can use super glue to hold them in
- All wing pieces attach to the sides of the 2020 extrusion using M5x10 BHCS bolts and M5 Slide in Nuts.  If there wasn't enough clearance to get a screw driver into the wing to tighten the bolt, a hole should've been added to the outside of the part to allow for access. 
- I recommend putting some super glue between the pieces when you attach them to the 2020 so that you reduce potential rattling or wiggle if any of the screws start to come out over time.
- I recommend when installing the electronics to put a disconnect on all wires going into the electronics compartment so if you need to change the wing set or the face plate you don't have to desolder anything. 
- Some wing sets have parts that are screwed to each other for stability.  See the BOM for the hardware needed for this.  

### Back
 - For the screw on backs, use slide-in nuts and the screws that the back requires to mount them to the 2020 extrusion. 
 - For the slide-in back, put in the pieces making sure that the holes allow access to the sections that need adjustment. 

### Head
- If you are using a wooden neck, you can skip this
- If you are using Nylon Strings, you want the classical Head.  

Follow the assembly guide in your chosen head and then come back here

### Neck
 - If you chose to use a wooden neck, you can attach it to the shoulder using a metal neck plate and the basic wood screws that come with the neck plate. 
 - If you are using a printed neck, follow the assembly guide and then come back here. 

### Take a breath
At this point you are done with the ExoGuitar setup for the printed parts; you should have a fully assembled guitar body without any actual guitar parts.  

### Electronics and Strings

Since there are limitless options for electronics, I'm not goint to try to describe how to install them all here.  I will say the following, however: 

- When attaching the ground wire that would normally attach to the bridge, if you're using the Bearing Bridge setup you need to attach the ground wire to the Heat Set inserts that the Strings attach to.  You can do this by either soldering wire to the Heat Set Inserts or by using conduictive tape with holes poked in it between the strings and the heat set inserts.  Both of these methods worked well for me.
- I suggest that you add quick-disconnects to all wires running between parts of the guitar, so you can remove those parts without having to remove all the electronics.  This will make maintence or upgrades MUCH easier.  You'll find that once you build your own guitar you keep wanting to tinker with it. 

For the strings, You will want to use Ball End strings.  Run the strings through the row of 6 heat set inserts, alllll the way through to the tensioners.  Put on the thickest string first, thren run it to the tensioner.  Tighten it just enough that it won't come out on it's own, and then slide in your nut plate.  If you are building an acoustic, this is where you will insert your bridge as well.  With all of the pieces in place, now run the rest of your strings.  Tighten them and tune your guitar. 

Now for the fine tuning: 
- Play each string without pressing on any frets.  If you hear any fret-buzz with the string open, you need to raise the strings using the nut using the screws on the back of the head. You will want to lower the nut as much as possible on both sides WITHOUT getting any fret buzz when the strings are open.  
- Play each string at each of the marked frets and listen for fret buzz.  If you have fret buzz at more than one fret, you need to raise the string at the saddle.  If you have fret buzz on only one of the frets (unless it's the last one) then you have a high fret that needs to be sanded down.  Please look up an actual luthier's guide for how to level your frets; but if you're using printed frets know that you need to consider them to be made of paly-dough in comparison to the metal ones so sand / file very lightly.  Once you sand the plastic away you can't put it back. 

For Acoustic core, and want to add Piezo Microphones, follow [these instructions](/models/Face%20Plates/Acoustic/OPTIONAL_ASSEMBLY_PIEZO.md)

Now that you have your electronics installed and your strings are on, plug it into an amp and check that you are getting sound.  If you aren't, check your wires.  I found in my builds that the most likely culprit was the ground wire to the strings.  Once you get sound going, you're done as well!

### Congratulations!
You now have your very own ExoGuitar.   Play it well and know that it's Truly your very own creation!  No-one else on EARTH has the same exact guitar as you; as you picked the colors, plastics, electronics, color patterns, faceplates, wingsets, neck, and head.  You may have even gone the extra mile and glued a hueforge to the front of it!   I hope you enjoy it!
