# Assembly

ExoGuitar is a complicated project.  It has a bunch of hardware and a bunch of different parts.  I hope you can understand how this can make documenting this a challenge, especially for a single person with a full-time job on top of a small business to run.  That being said; there are likely gaps in this documentation.  If you want to assist, it is EXTREMELY welcone for you to reach out. 

# Choosing your parts

Before you start printing an ExoGuitar, you need to decide which kind of guitar you are trying to build.  Do you want an electric or an accoustic?  Printed neck or wooden neck?  What body style do you want? Headless or Head?  Printed bridge or one off-the-shelf?

One day I hope I can have the time and resources to build a configurator.  For right now, however, this is a pretty manual process. 

There are 7 main parts that each have their own options:

1. [Shoulder](/models/Shoulders/)
    - Offset 
        - [ExoGuitar Neck](/models/Shoulders/Offset%20-%20ExoGuitar%20Neck/)
        - [Wood Neck](/models/Shoulders/Offset%20-%20Regular%20Neck/)
    - Paralell
        - [Wood Neck](/models/Shoulders/Parallel%20-%20Regular%20Neck/)
2. [Neck](/models/Neck/) - Note: you can skip this if you use a wooden neck
    - [Metal Frets](/models/Neck/Neck%20with%20Metal%20Frets/) - Note: this is a REALLY intensive build
    - [Printed Frets](/models/Neck/Neck%20with%20Printed%20Frets/)
3. [Head](/models/Head/) - Note: you can skip this if you use a wooden neck
    - [Classical](/models/Head/Classical/ASSEMBLY.md)
    - [Regular](/models/Head/Head/)
    - [Headless](/models/Head/Headless%20Adjustable%20Nut/)
4. [Bridge](/models/Bridge/)
    - Headless 
        - [Headless for Bearing Bridge](/models/Bridge/Headless%20Bridge%20Plate/)
        - [Alnicov 6 Strings Saddle Headless](/models/Bridge/Alnicov%206%20Strings%20Saddle%20Headless/)
    - Head
        - [Thru-Body Bearing Bridge](/models/Bridge/Thru-Body%20Bridge%20Plate%20-%20Bearing%20Bridge/)
        - [Thru-Body for Tune-o-Matic](/models/Bridge/Thru-Body%20Bridge%20Plate%20-%20Tune-O-matic/)
        - [Blank](/models/Bridge/Blank/) - Note: this is a starting point for you to model your own bridge
