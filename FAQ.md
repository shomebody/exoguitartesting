# Frequently Asked Questions

## Does it play?
Yes.

## Do I need any specific Hardware?
Yes.  You will need: 

- A 0.2 nozzle is required for some small gears used in one of the heads.  You will need a M5 or M6 tap depending on what size the hole in your 2020 extrusion is.  

Also, for best results, a printer that can print High-Temp plastics is HIGHLY recommended.  

## What plastic should I use where?

You should print the Core / Neck / Head out of ABS / PC-ABS / ASA.

The gears in the Classical Head's Tuners should use PA / PC / PC-ABS / PLA+ Tough.  Note that this REQUIRES a 0.2mm nozzle so no CF or GF filaments. 

You can print the Wings out of whatever you want.  If you're going to be playing or displaying this anywhere that the Sun can touch this guitar, I recommend NOT using PLA for them.  I make my own using PC-ABS, ABS, and ASA.  Usually Ambrosia from West3D.
