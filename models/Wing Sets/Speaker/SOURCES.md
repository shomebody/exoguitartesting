The electronics needed for this kit are based on the work done by [翻滚吧咸鱼 (@user_2955528674) on MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/@user_2955528674)
on their model that can be found [here](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1152391-built-in-speaker-playable-electric-guitar?from=recommend#profileId-1156748).

I have also borrowed their wiring diagram.
