# Assembly
Note: Fill in any gaps from this documentation with pieces from the [Neck with metal frets](../Neck%20with%20Metal%20Frets/ASSEMBLY.md) documentation

## Step 1: Insert Fret Indicators

Choose your Indicator type

### LED's

- Run two wires up the core of the neck to act as rails.  Either run two bare wires or strip segments of the wire around each fret indicator; these wires should be placed in the inside of the neck plate, on the backside of the face, one on each side of the neck.  Use dots of hot glue to glue these wires into place every few inches, making sure that the wires cannot touch each other if they are bare. I highly recommend that you put connectors between the different sections of the neck if you think there's even a small chance you may take the neck apart some day. 
- Cut 1x 1mm long pieces of white or other light-colored filament for each indicator, so x24 in total
- Bore out indicator holes using a 2mm drill bit
- Insert LED's into the indicator holes wires first, and then pull them in snug from the center of the neck plate.
- Add a touch of super glue into each indicator hole and while it's still wet push in the 1mm filament piece.
- Wire the LED's to the rail

### Filament Pieces

For each indicator hole: 
- Bore out indicator holes using a 2mm drill bit
- Add a small dot of super glue into the hole
- Put in some filament and cut it flush to the side of the neck

## Step 2: Tap 2020
Drill and tap one end of the 2020 extrusion with an M5 thread. 

## Step 3: Install head onto 2020
Install the Head you wish to use from the ExoGuitar Collection.

## Step 4: Install Neck Segments
Starting at the head and working your way down to the shoulder, for each neck segment, perform the following steps:

### Step 4a: Insert Slide In Nuts

### Step 4b: Install Neck Plate
Attach the neck plate to the 2020 extrusion using the M5 BHCS.  
The shorter M5 screws are used near the top of the neck.  The longer ones near the bottom.  

## Step 5: Assemble Shoulder
Assemble the shoulder and attach.

## Step 6: Sand Frets
Optional: Use a sanding block to ensure frets are in-line with each other.  Be sure to not sand too much away!
