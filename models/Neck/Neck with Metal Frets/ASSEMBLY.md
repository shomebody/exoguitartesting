## Step 7: Install Frets

### Bend Frets using Fret Bender

### Install Frets using Pliers

### Clip off excess Fret Wire

### Install LED's or Filament dots
Install LED's into the holes in the side of the front plate, wire them together inside of the neck.  Further documentation may come at some point. 
If you don't want the LED's to light up, just shove a piece of a contrasting filament into the hole with some glue and clip it off. 

### Repeat for all Frets

### Repeat for all plates

## Step 8: Attach Front Plate to Grips

To acomplish this, I have found this to be the easiest method.  Starting with the top plate: 

### Put in the top corner screw and tighten it.

### Clamp the front plate to the Grips using the Fret Jig

### Screw in all of the rest of the M2 Screws

### Clamp and Glue
For each fret, move the Clamp + Gig to that fret, then add some Thick CA glue into the side of the fret crack and also put some on the transition between the Neck and the Front plates, filling in any gaps.

Repeat Step 8 for all of the front plates

## Step 9: (Optional) Glue in Plugs 

Glue in the Plugs over the screw holes

## Step 10: The great sanding

Sand and polish the frets.  Sand the grips.  Sand everything until it's smooth and comfortable to play.  For the grips, I used 80 grit then 160 grit, then 300 grit, then 600 grit, and finally 1000 grit.

For the Frets, I recommend finding a guide by an actual luthier on how to sand, file, and smooth them instead of listening to me about it.  You'll likely end up with a better guitar. 

And you're done!
