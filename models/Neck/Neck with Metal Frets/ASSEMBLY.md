# Assembly Instructions for Neck with Metal Frets

- Attach the head to the 500mm 2020 extrusion
- Attach the Top Neck Grip Section to the 2020 extrusion using the M5x6 Screws, M5x8 screws and 2020 Slide In Nuts so it's pressed up against the bottom of the head. 
- Repeat for the Middle and bottom Sections of the neck grip using the M5x10 screws
- Install the frets in the face plates.  See pictures below for how to do that.  IMPORTANT: do this while the face plate is OFF of the neck, as screwing it into the neck will lock the frets in place. 
- If you're installing the lights, install them now and wire them up in parallel.  I did this by running two “rail” wires down the neck; one positive and one negative, and attaching all the LED wires to these rails.  
- Screw in the face plates from the top to the bottom.  In sequence for each fret as you go, clamp the fret using the jig and then squeeze some glue into both the the fret recess and along the seam from the face plates to the grip.  Once the glue is dry, move on to the next fret and repeat.  When you pass a screw, install it.    Accelerator spray will greatly speed up this process. 
- Optionally glue in the bolt hole caps.  I used hot glue for this and it worked well. 
- Sand the back of the neck using incrementally finer grits until the back is as smooth as you want it.  
- Perform basic Fret installation procedure that you would on any guitar.  File and Sand the frets, etc… 
- Admire your work.  This was a lot and you should be proud of yourself.
