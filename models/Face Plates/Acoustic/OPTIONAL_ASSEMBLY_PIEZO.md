# Optional Assembly Step: Piezo Mic

If you are building an acoustic and you don't want to install pezio mics, your build is now complete!

If you ARE building an acoustic and you want to install Pezio Mics, remove the back panel and place the microphones on the inside of the face plate.  

These are some suggested locations: ![alt text](./models/Face%20Plates/Acoustic/exploded%20views/Pezio%20Locations.png) 

This will give you Highs, Lows, and taps (if you tap on the guitar body).  

If you don't want taps, you can just put all three of them in a line across the thick part.  I have found that a single Mic in the center also works pretty well. ~~~~
