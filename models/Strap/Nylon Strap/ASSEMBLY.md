I do not know how to document sewing steps; but here's the jist of it.  

You will *NEED* a heavy duty sewing machine to make this strap correctly. 

Assemble the pieces like this:

To attach the end-pieces, thread the strap through the piece and then fold it over on itself twice, then sew it in place.  I did 3 passes of zig-zag stich.

Red is thread, black is Nylon, Yellow is endpiece. 

Here's generally how the straps and pieces need to be laid out:

Once that's done, attach the strap to the M3 adapters using the 2mmx30mm pins.
