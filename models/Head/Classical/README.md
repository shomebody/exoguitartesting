# Classical Head

## Plastic Choices

I have now tested this with several types of plastic and can say for certain that you can build functional classical heads out of:
- ABS
- ASA
- PC-ABS
- PLA Tough (at 90% infill and 10 walls)
- PETG-HF (at 90% infill and 10 walls)
- PA

I would still say that you need to be careful regarding the placement of the guitar in relation to the sun if you choose to use PLA Tough or PETG of any form.  

I have had very good results using PLA Tough for the gears.  I did NOT have good results using regular PLA for the gears.  Specifically, I recommend PLA that was made from 3DC870 Resin like (3D Fuel Tough PLA+)[https://amzn.to/43JGNtU] for it's specific mechanical properties (Special shout out to @nte on the West3D Discord for this).

## To use: 

- Put the string through the hole in the shaft.  If the string can't pass through, loosen the lock knob (the one on the side of the head).  
- Pull the string through the hole until it is taught but not so taught that it could produce a note if plucked.  
- Tighten the Lock Knob until you can no-longer pull or push the string through the hole.  Be careful to not overtighten, as this could lead to the screw cutting the string.  
- Snip off the end of the string.  Do yourself a favor and leave 2-3mm so if you have to remove the string you have a chance of putting it back in. 
- Tighten the tuning knob in the direction that makes the shaft spin so the string wraps over the top of the shaft.  Tighten until the string reaches the desired pitch.  If you are using Nylon Strings, your instrument will not reach a stable tune for a couple of days and you will have to - - repeat this process every few hours; as Nylon Strings have a 2-3 day break in period.  During this time it is important that you tune it every 2-3 hours. 


## Important Note about the printed gears: 

The printed gears are a challenging print and require a 0.2 nozzle.  They are not forgiving.

If you have trouble with the printed gears, you can use [these](https://amzn.to/4l2Nihy) instead.  Glue them to the M2 screw instead of using locktite.  The issue that caused me to remove these from the BOM and design my own printed screws is that the glue doesn't always hold and you may end up having to re-apply glue before you can tune it again, but if for whatever reason you can't get your strings up to tune due to printing defects that'd likely be less of an issue.
