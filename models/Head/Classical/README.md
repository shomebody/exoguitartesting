## To use: 

- Put the string through the hole in the shaft.  If the string can't pass through, loosen the lock knob (the one on the side of the head).  
- Pull the string through the hole until it is taught but not so taught that it could produce a note if plucked.  
- Tighten the Lock Knob until you can no-longer pull or push the string through the hole.  Be careful to not overtighten, as this could lead to the screw cutting the string.  
- Snip off the end of the string.  Do yourself a favor and leave 2-3mm so if you have to remove the string you have a chance of putting it back in. 
- Tighten the tuning knob in the direction that makes the shaft spin so the string wraps over the top of the shaft.  Tighten until the string reaches the desired pitch.  If you are using Nylon Strings, your instrument will not reach a stable tune for a couple of days and you will have to - - repeat this process every few hours; as Nylon Strings have a 2-3 day break in period.  During this time it is important that you tune it every 2-3 hours.
