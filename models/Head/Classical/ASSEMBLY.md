# Assembly

After printing, make sure you clean out ALL support material.  The smallest amount in the gearboxes can cause interference, the tollerances are very tight.  

## Step 1: Put in Heat Set Inserts

#### Step 3a: Cut TPU Filament Stubs

Cut 6x 5mm long pieces of TPU filament.  A model for a jig to cut these to size easily is included [here](./ExoGuitar%20-%20TPU%20Cutting%20Jig.3mf)

#### Step 3b: Assemble Shaft

Note that the TPU filament piece is inserted BEFORE the heat set insert is installed. 

#### Step 3e: Prep Worm gear
 
Using a 3/32 drill bit, remove 3mm of material from one side of the worm gear hole.  Then install the heat set insert into that hole.  BE CAREFUL and make sure you go in straight and that you don't melt the gear teeth. 

#### Step 3f: Assemble Knob

The screw should go right up to the end of the worm gear but not stick out of it.   
Use locktite or super glue to lock the screw into the gear.  I recommend Locktite Red

#### Step 3r: Install Tensioners
